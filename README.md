Hello, smart engineer reading this. This repository marks my (santiago diaz) submission for xAI's take-home coding challenge. 

I'll take the challenge tomorrow (~8pm CST), but I'm leaving this here as a note and to get a generic repo scaffolded to avoid having to do this later. 

Thank you!

(best of luck to my future self)
